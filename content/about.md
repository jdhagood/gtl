Hello world, my name is JD Hagood, and I will be your instructor for this introduction to python class! I am looking forward to meeting everyone and teaching my favorite programming language!


# Where am I from?

I grew up in Clinton, Mississippi, USA  with my parents and older sister. I attended a local highschool until my junior year and transferred to a public math and science magnet boarding school in the northern part of the state.


# What do I study?
I am currently studying electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I am on the MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team (SEVT) with the electrical engineering subteam.


# What do I do for fun?
I spend much of my freetime in makerspaces on campus working on projects, like this etch-a-sketch that will draw whatever you ask it to. This is when I asked it to draw a "dog with sunglasses." I am a 3D printing nerd and love to CAD things.

I also enjoy the outdoors. This past summer I went on a cross country bike trip from Washington D.C. to San Francisco, CA and taught STEM along the way with [MIT Spokes](https://www.mitspokes.com/). This was our route.
