Hello, my name is JD, and I will be your instructor for this introduction to python class! I am looking forward to meeting everyone and teaching my favorite programming language: python.
# Where am I from?

I grew up in Clinton, Mississippi USA.

# What do I study?
I am currently studying electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT). I am on the MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team (SEVT) in the electrical engineering subteam.

# What do I do for fun?
I spend much of my freetime in makerspaces on campus working on projects, like this etch-a-sketch that will draw whatever you ask it to. This is when I asked it to draw a "dog with sunglasses."

This past summer I went on a cross country bike trip and taught STEM along the way with [MIT Spokes](https://www.mitspokes.com/). This was our route:
